This was my first try with canvas it was done over the weeekend as part of my bootcamp training.

The biggest chalange I encountered here was a misleading plan. I took a route that caused the Meme lines to act as one

when it comes to style changeing.

For a new progrmaer planing a head is a real challange. 

In Order to be able to finish on time I went all the way to fully functional Meme Maker with the mistake I did and only 

after I knew I had an MVP in hand I refactored the code. (a challange on it's own but very satisfactionary)
